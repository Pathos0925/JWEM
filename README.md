## Also
 - Any Dinosaurs you add should be detected automatically and added to the list. If you have a skin for that species, you should see a dropdown box that will let you select a new one
- Currently, only BASIC SKINS are detected and changable. Additionally, any changes to the basic skin will affect every dinosaur with that skin
- Add JWEMS skins to the skins folder. 
	- Included is a basic skin for Ankylosaurus called Ankylosaurus Blue. After loading it, you should see a blue Ankylosaurus.
