 - Any Dinosaurs you add should be detected automatically and added to the list. If you have a skin for that species, you should see a dropdown box that will let you select a new one.
	- Currently, only BASIC SKINS are detected and changable. Additionally, any changes to the basic skin will affect every dinosaur with that skin.
